## Production Deployment

### **Before Going Live:**
1. Replace test Stripe keys with live keys
2. Set up Stripe webhooks for order confirmation
3. Configure proper SSL certificate
4. Test payment flow thoroughly
5. Set up monitoring and logging

### **Stripe Webhook Setup:**
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard â†’ Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/payment/webhook`
3. Select events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`
4. Copy webhook secret to `.env`

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:
- Invalid card details
- Insufficient funds
- Network connectivity issues
- Payment gateway downtime
- Database transaction failures

## Logging

Payment activities are logged to:
- Laravel logs (`storage/logs/laravel.log`)
- Database order records
- Payment gateway transaction logs

## Support

For payment-related issues:
1. Check Laravel logs for errors
2. Verify Stripe API keys are correct
3. Ensure webhook endpoints are accessible
4. Test with Stripe's test cards

## Security Considerations

- Never log credit card details
- Use HTTPS in production
- Validate all payment data server-side
- Implement proper session management
- Regular security updates for Stripe SDK
